# Flappy Bird!
Flappy bird in the terminal! To run just type make and then run ./flappy_bird 

For best results, use the arrow keys. Works a lot smoother that way idk why. Any other key will do too but it you really gotta spam it.

Pretty simple implementation, might add some features here and there but honestly I could care less. This was literally just made for when I get bored in class lol

If you want to add an alias to the file to your bashrc/zshrc, do the following commands (default alias is fb, change it in the file): 
```
chmod +x ./alias.sh
./alias.sh
```
and then source your rc file
